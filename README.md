# Tetris Game ‚Äî React + Vite

This repository contains a simple and fun **Tetris game** built with **React** and **Vite**.

## About the Project

This is a **no-code Tetris game** ‚Äî the entire project structure and logic were generated with the help of ChatGPT, without manually writing the game logic from scratch.  
It demonstrates how AI-assisted coding can quickly turn an idea into a working project.

The game leverages React‚Äôs component-based architecture combined with Vite‚Äôs fast build tool and hot module replacement (HMR) to provide a smooth development experience and fast load times.

- **React** handles the UI components and game logic.  
- **Vite** enables lightning-fast builds and instant updates during development.  
- **ESLint** is configured to help keep the code clean and maintainable.
