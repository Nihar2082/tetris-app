# Tetris Game — React + Vite

This repository contains a simple and fun **Tetris game** built with **React** and **Vite**.

## About the Project

The project leverages React’s component-based architecture combined with Vite’s fast build tool and hot module replacement (HMR) to provide a smooth development experience and fast load times.

- **React** handles the UI components and game logic.
- **Vite** enables lightning-fast builds and instant updates during development.
- **ESLint** is configured to help keep the code clean and maintainable.

This setup uses modern JavaScript tooling and best practices to create a minimal yet fully functional Tetris game.

## How to Play

Use your keyboard to control the falling blocks:

- **Arrow Left / Right:** Move the piece left or right  
- **Arrow Down:** Speed up the piece falling  
- **Arrow Up or Space:** Rotate the piece  
- **P:** Pause or resume the game  

Clear horizontal lines by filling them completely to score points.

The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the playfield.

**Note:** The game is optimized for desktop use with keyboard controls.
